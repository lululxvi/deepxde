DeepXDE supports five tensor libraries as backends: TensorFlow 1.x (`tensorflow.compat.v1` in TensorFlow 2.x), TensorFlow 2.x, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle. For how to select one, see [Working with different backends](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#working-with-different-backends).

## Features

DeepXDE has implemented many algorithms as shown above and supports many features:

- enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation.
- **complex domain geometries** without tyranny mesh generation. The primitive geometries are interval, triangle, rectangle, polygon, disk, ellipse, star-shaped, cuboid, sphere, hypercube, and hypersphere. Other geometries can be constructed as constructive solid geometry (CSG) using three boolean operations: union, difference, and intersection. DeepXDE also supports a geometry represented by a point cloud.
- 5 types of **boundary conditions** (BCs): Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, periodic, and a general BC, which can be defined on an arbitrary domain or on a point set; and approximate distance functions for **hard constraints**.
- 3 **automatic differentiation** (AD) methods to compute derivatives: reverse mode (i.e., backpropagation), forward mode, and zero coordinate shift (ZCS).
- different **neural networks**: fully connected neural network (FNN), stacked FNN, residual neural network, (spatio-temporal) multi-scale Fourier feature networks, etc.
- many **sampling methods**: uniform, pseudorandom, Latin hypercube sampling, Halton sequence, Hammersley sequence, and Sobol sequence. The training points can keep the same during training or be resampled (adaptively) every certain iterations.
- 4 **function spaces**: power series, Chebyshev polynomial, Gaussian random field (1D/2D).
- **data-parallel training** on multiple GPUs.
- different **optimizers**: Adam, L-BFGS, etc.
- conveniently **save** the model during training, and **load** a trained model.
- **callbacks** to monitor the internal states and statistics of the model during training: early stopping, etc.
- **uncertainty quantification** using dropout.
- **float16**, **float32**, and **float64**.
- many other useful features: different (weighted) losses, learning rate schedules, metrics, etc.

All the components of DeepXDE are loosely coupled, and thus DeepXDE is well-structured and highly configurable. It is easy to customize DeepXDE to meet new demands.

## Installation

DeepXDE requires one of the following backend-specific dependencies to be installed:

- TensorFlow 1.x: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)>=2.7.0
- TensorFlow 2.x: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)>=2.3.0, [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)>=0.11.0
- PyTorch: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)>=1.9.0
- JAX: [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io), [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io), [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io)
- PaddlePaddle: [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en)>=2.6.0

Then, you can install DeepXDE itself.

- Install the stable version with `pip`:

``` sh
$ pip install deepxde
```

- Install the stable version with `conda`:

``` sh
$ conda install -c conda-forge deepxde
```

- For developers, you should clone the folder to your local machine and put it along with your project scripts.

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde.git
```

## The Team

DeepXDE was developed by [Lu Lu](https://github.com/lululxvi) under the supervision of Prof. [George Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) from the summer of 2018 to 2020. DeepXDE was originally self-hosted in Subversion at Brown University, under the name SciCoNet (Scientific Computing Neural Networks). On Feb 7, 2019, SciCoNet was moved from Subversion to GitHub, renamed to DeepXDE.

DeepXDE is currently maintained by [Lu Lu](https://github.com/lululxvi) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu) with major contributions coming from many talented individuals in various forms and means. A non-exhaustive but growing list needs to mention: [Paul Escapil-Inchauspé](https://github.com/pescap), [Zongren Zou](https://github.com/ZongrenZou), [Jialin Li](https://github.com/lijialin03), [Saransh Chopra](https://github.com/Saransh-cpp), [Sensen He](https://github.com/HydrogenSulfate), [Vladimir Dudenkov](https://github.com/vl-dud), [Anran Jiao](https://github.com/anranjiao), [Zhongyi Jiang](https://github.com/Jerry-Jzy), [Shunyuan Mao](https://github.com/smao-astro).
