"""This file defines the unified tensor framework interface required by DeepXDE.

The principles of this interface:
* There should be as few interfaces as possible.
* The interface is used by DeepXDE system so it is more important to have
  clean definition rather than convenient usage.
* Default arguments should be avoided.
* Keyword or positional arguments should be avoided.
* Argument type should be easier to understand.

It is recommended the frameworks implement all the interfaces. However, it is
also OK to skip some. The generated backend module has an ``is_enabled`` function
that returns whether the interface is supported by the framework or not.

def data_type_dict():
    """Returns a dictionary from data type string to the data type.

    The dictionary should include at least:

    This function will be called only *once* during the initialization of the backend

        >>> def data_type_dict():
        >>>     return {'float16': tf.float16, 'float32': tf.float32, ...}
