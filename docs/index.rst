DeepXDE supports five tensor libraries as backends: TensorFlow 1.x (``tensorflow.compat.v1`` in TensorFlow 2.x), TensorFlow 2.x, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle. For how to select one, see `Working with different backends <https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html#working-with-different-backends>`_.

Features
--------

DeepXDE has implemented many algorithms as shown above and supports many features:

- enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation.
- **complex domain geometries** without tyranny mesh generation. The primitive geometries are interval, triangle, rectangle, polygon, disk, ellipse, star-shaped, cuboid, sphere, hypercube, and hypersphere. Other geometries can be constructed as constructive solid geometry (CSG) using three boolean operations: union, difference, and intersection. DeepXDE also supports a geometry represented by a point cloud.
- 5 types of **boundary conditions** (BCs): Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, periodic, and a general BC, which can be defined on an arbitrary domain or on a point set; and approximate distance functions for **hard constraints**.
- 3 **automatic differentiation** (AD) methods to compute derivatives: reverse mode (i.e., backpropagation), forward mode, and zero coordinate shift (ZCS).
- different **neural networks**: fully connected neural network (FNN), stacked FNN, residual neural network, (spatio-temporal) multi-scale Fourier feature networks, etc.
- many **sampling methods**: uniform, pseudorandom, Latin hypercube sampling, Halton sequence, Hammersley sequence, and Sobol sequence. The training points can keep the same during training or be resampled (adaptively) every certain iterations.
- 4 **function spaces**: power series, Chebyshev polynomial, Gaussian random field (1D/2D).
- **data-parallel training** on multiple GPUs.
- different **optimizers**: Adam, L-BFGS, etc.
- conveniently **save** the model during training, and **load** a trained model.
- **callbacks** to monitor the internal states and statistics of the model during training: early stopping, etc.
- **uncertainty quantification** using dropout.
- **float16**, **float32**, and **float64**.
- many other useful features: different (weighted) losses, learning rate schedules, metrics, etc.

All the components of DeepXDE are loosely coupled, and thus DeepXDE is well-structured and highly configurable. It is easy to customize DeepXDE to meet new demands.
