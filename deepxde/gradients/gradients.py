    Use this function to compute first-order derivatives instead of ``tf.gradients()``
    or ``torch.autograd.grad()``, because

    - It is lazy evaluation, i.e., it only computes J[i, j] when needed.
    - It will remember the gradients that have already been computed to avoid duplicate
      computation.

    Args:
        ys: Output Tensor of shape (batch_size, dim_y).
        xs: Input Tensor of shape (batch_size, dim_x).
        i (int or None): `i`th row. If `i` is ``None``, returns the `j`th column

        j (int or None): `j`th column. If `j` is ``None``, returns the `i`th row
            J[`i`, :], i.e., the gradient of y_i. `i` and `j` cannot be both ``None``,
            unless J has only one element, which is returned.

    Returns:
        (`i`, `j`)th entry J[`i`, `j`], `i`th row J[`i`, :], or `j`th column J[:, `j`].
