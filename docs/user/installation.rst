Install and Setup
=================

Installation
------------

DeepXDE requires one of the following backend-specific dependencies to be installed:

- TensorFlow 1.x: `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_>=2.7.0

    - If you use TensorFlow 2.16+ and have an error with Keras 3, to keep using Keras 2, you can first install `tf-keras <https://pypi.org/project/tf-keras>`_, and then set the environment variable ``TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1`` directly or in your python program with ``import os;os.environ["TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS"]="1"``. [`Reference <https://keras.io/keras_3>`_]

- TensorFlow 2.x: `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_>=2.3.0, `TensorFlow Probability <https://www.tensorflow.org/probability>`_>=0.11.0

    - For TensorFlow 2.16+ with Keras 3, refer to `the instruction <https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/releases/tag/v0.24.0>`_ for installing TensorFlow Probability.

- PyTorch: `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_>=1.9.0
- JAX: `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io>`_, `Flax <https://flax.readthedocs.io>`_, `Optax <https://optax.readthedocs.io>`_
- PaddlePaddle: `PaddlePaddle <https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/en>`_>=2.6.0

Then, you can install DeepXDE itself.

- Install the stable version with ``pip``::

    $ pip install deepxde

- Install the stable version with ``conda``::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge deepxde

- For developers, you should clone the folder to your local machine and put it along with your project scripts::

    $ git clone https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde.git

- Other dependencies

    - `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
    - `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
    - `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_
    - `scikit-optimize <https://scikit-optimize.github.io>`_
    - `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_

Docker
------

The `DeepXDE Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/pescapil/deepxde>`_ is configured to run DeepXDE with the GPU support. You need first to install `NVIDIA Docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_. Then you can run a Jupyter Notebook environment with GPU-enabled stable DeepXDE using::

    $ nvidia-docker run -v $(pwd):/root/shared -w "/root/shared" -p 8888:8888 pescapil/deepxde:latest

The `Dockerfile <https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde/tree/master/docker/Dockerfile>`_ is based on `Horovod Docker image <https://hub.docker.com/r/horovod/horovod>`_ with TensorFlow and PyTorch. To build a DeepXDE image, you can run::

    $ git clone https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde.git
    $ cd deepxde/docker
    $ docker build -f Dockerfile . -t deepxde

and then run your own DeepXDE image via::

$ nvidia-docker run -v $(pwd):/root/shared -w "/root/shared" -p 8888:8888 deepxde

Working with different backends
-------------------------------

DeepXDE supports TensorFlow 1.x (``tensorflow.compat.v1`` in TensorFlow 2.x), TensorFlow 2.x, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle backends. DeepXDE will choose the backend on the following options (high priority to low priority)

* Use the ``DDE_BACKEND`` environment variable:

    - You can use ``DDE_BACKEND=BACKEND python pde.py`` to specify the backend. Currently ``BACKEND`` can be chosen from "tensorflow.compat.v1" (TensorFlow 1.x backend), "tensorflow" (TensorFlow 2.x backend), "pytorch" (PyTorch), "jax" (JAX), and "paddle" (PaddlePaddle).

    $ DDE_BACKEND=tensorflow.compat.v1 python pde.py

    $ DDE_BACKEND=tensorflow python pde.py

    $ DDE_BACKEND=pytorch python pde.py

    $ DDE_BACKEND=jax python pde.py

    $ DDE_BACKEND=paddle python pde.py

    - Or set the global environment variable ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``BACKEND``. In Linux, this usually can be done via ``export DDE_BACKEND=BACKEND``; in Windows, set the environment variable ``DDE_BACKEND`` in System Settings

* Modify the ``config.json`` file under "~/.deepxde":

    - The file has the content such as ``{"backend": "tensorflow.compat.v1"}``
    - You can also use ``python -m deepxde.backend.set_default_backend BACKEND`` to set the default backend
    - In Windows, you can find ``config.json`` file under "C:/Users/Username/.deepxde" directory

* If no backend is selected as above, DeepXDE will automatically find an available backend.

Which backend should I choose?

Here is a comparison between different backends:

- Different backends support slightly different features, and switch to another backend if DeepXDE raised a backend-related error.
    - Currently, the number of features supported is: PaddlePaddle ≈ TensorFlow 1.x > TensorFlow 2.x ≈ PyTorch > JAX.
    - Some features can be implemented easily (basically translating from one framework to another), and we welcome your contributions.
- Different backends have different computational speed, and switch to another backend if the speed is an issue in your case.
    - We find that there is no backend that is always faster than the others.
    - The speed depends on the specific problem, the dataset size, your hardware, etc. In some cases, one backend could be significantly faster than others such as 4x faster.
    - If you are not sure which one is the fastest for your problem, in general, we recommend TensorFlow 2.x, because we find that in some cases TensorFlow 2.x > PyTorch > TensorFlow 1.x (> means faster).

TensorFlow 1.x backend
``````````````````````

Export ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``tensorflow.compat.v1`` to specify TensorFlow 1.x backend. Essentially, TensorFlow 1.x backend uses the API `tensorflow.compat.v1 <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1>`_ in TensorFlow 2.x and disables the eager execution:

.. code:: python

   import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
   tf.disable_eager_execution()

In addition, DeepXDE will set ``TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH`` to ``true`` to prevent TensorFlow take over the whole GPU memory.

TensorFlow 2.x backend
``````````````````````

Export ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``tensorflow`` to specify TensorFlow 2.x backend. In addition, DeepXDE will set ``TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH`` to ``true`` to prevent TensorFlow take over the whole GPU memory.

PyTorch backend
```````````````

Export ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``pytorch`` to specify PyTorch backend. In addition, if GPU is available, DeepXDE will set the default tensor type to cuda, so that all the tensors will be created on GPU as default:

.. code:: python

    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.set_default_tensor_type(torch.cuda.FloatTensor)

JAX backend
```````````

Export ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``jax`` to specify JAX backend.

PaddlePaddle backend
````````````````````

Export ``DDE_BACKEND`` as ``paddle`` to specify PaddlePaddle backend. In addition, if GPU is available, DeepXDE will set the default device to GPU, so that all the tensors will be created on GPU as default:

.. code:: python

    if paddle.device.is_compiled_with_cuda():
        paddle.device.set_device("gpu")
