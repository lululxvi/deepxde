The Team
========

DeepXDE was developed by `Lu Lu <https://lu.seas.upenn.edu>`_ under the supervision of Prof. `George Karniadakis <https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis>`_ at `Brown University <https://www.brown.edu>`_ from the summer of 2018 to 2020, supported by `PhILMs <https://www.pnnl.gov/computing/philms>`_. DeepXDE was originally self-hosted in Subversion at Brown University, under the name SciCoNet (Scientific Computing Neural Networks). On Feb 7, 2019, SciCoNet was moved from Subversion to GitHub, renamed to DeepXDE.

DeepXDE is currently maintained by `Lu Lu <https://lu.seas.upenn.edu>`_ at `University of Pennsylvania <https://www.upenn.edu>`_ with major contributions coming from several talented individuals in various forms and means. A non-exhaustive but growing list needs to mention: `Zongren Zou <https://github.com/ZongrenZou>`_, `Zhongyi Jiang <https://github.com/Jerry-Jzy>`_, `Shunyuan Mao <https://github.com/smao-astro>`_, `Paul Escapil-Inchauspé <https://github.com/pescap>`_.
